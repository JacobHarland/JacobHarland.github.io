          <p><strong>Please read this first!</strong></p>
          <p>This tool generates a layout that is responsive, which means it looks great on phones! Use dropdowns above
            to
            customize your layout's general features. Click the button to generate your HTML and CSS, and paste it into
            a
            file on Neocities.</p>
          <p>Then you can replace all of the text with your own. For more customization, the CSS code has comments to
            explain what each part changes. Please read through the code - even if you have no idea what it means.</p>
          <p>If you're feeling up for a challenge, I put together <a
              href="https://learn.sadgrl.online/understanding-tweaking-my-layout-maker/" target="_blank">a guide</a>
            which
            goes over the structure of how this layout is built, along with some specific tips on how to edit it in
            certain ways.</p>

        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
          <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
          <p>This site is very cool as it's a wiki! Any student or staff of Yale is free to edit the webpage
            which I think is very unique for a college such as yale. This does however mean the design of the website is
            quite poor.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contrast - There is most definitely some contrast here on this website. However, it is not good. There
              is
              too much contrast in too many places, it looks totally random and you have no idea what to look at.</li>
            <li>Repetition - Not much repetition is happening on this website. The colors are all over the place,
              different pages have different background colors or pictures.</li>
            <li>Alignment - The alignment on this page is atrocious. It is all over the place. Everything is inside of a
              grid/column, and it is still terrible alignment wise.</li>
            <li>Proximity - At the very least, I would say the proximity of elements is quite good. There doesn't appear
              to be a place on the website where it's just random information mixed with other random information.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3><a href="https://myboardwalk.ca/">Boardwalk Insurance</a></h3>
          <p>Boardwalk Insurance has a very eye catching design. The orange really stands out as well as the hand drawn
            art on the page giving it a friendly feeling.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contrast - The contrast on this website is excellent. The colors really pop, the font sizes make sense
              throughout the page, and the spacing between each element is good as well.</li>
            <li>Repetition - Each webpage on this site follows the same exact colors, layout and style. They all also
              have the cute hand drawn elements, each page clearly feels like it's part of the same website</li>
            <li>Alignment - Everything is placed carefully on this website. Nothing sticks out like a sore thumb.
              Everything is unified and aligned in a visually appealing way.</li>
            <li>Proximity - The proximity is also great here. There is some spacing between similar elements with an
              increased spacing for unrelated elements, cluing you in that it's a different section.</li>

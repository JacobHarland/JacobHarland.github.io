    <p>I'm Katharine McLain, I have always been a HUGE lover of pets and all kinds of animals! Some of my
      earliest memories include my childhood pets. There's always been some kind of cat or dog in the house throughout
      my whole life. There's been happy times with laughter and new babies, and sadder times during the loss of our
      older pets. We've adopted through animal shelters, off the streets, through friends and family. When one pet
      finds their “furrever” home, another one always seems to come along into our lives.
    </p>

    <p>One of the best experiences in animal caregiving is the birth of eight kittens. We worked hard with the babies,
      making sure that mama cat was doing well the whole way. The vets were super pleased that all eight of the fur
      babies grew up healthy and strong! It was so different compared to the loss of our older cats, both of whom were
      over 15 years old and we rescued them from living on the streets. I wouldn't trade it for the world though. It's
      made me who I am, and I will always be glad to have the memories of both sides of animal caregiving.
